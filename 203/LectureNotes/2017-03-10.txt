# write java program that reads a file one word at time - will be part of assignment one
* "reader" takes a byte stream and converts to chars - treats input as lines of chars
* reader methods: getline[ gets str from input ], 
* "BufferedReader" reads ahead
* "BufferedWriter" 
* "scanner" like a reader, but parses data in different ways ( i.e. getNextInt, getNextFloat,  etc.) and is slower - 1KB at a time
* dont read too much with a scanner
* open file in file object, then wrap file object in scanner object `Scanner sc = new Scanner( new File(args[0]));`
* file and scanner not in base java lib - import with `import java.io.File;`, `import java.util.Scanner;`
* Scanner.hasNext returns true if there is something to read 
* Scanner.next returns the next token from the scanner/file as a string
* Scanners default token is whitespace
