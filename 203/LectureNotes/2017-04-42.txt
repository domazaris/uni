Test:
* Java questions - main routine, public/private, strings etc.
* bits of java code 
* partial defn of linked list - write insert method/write remove method/swap 2 elements etc.


Binary Search Trees:
* Self referential structures - nodes: (key, data, bigger, smaller)
* Methods: insert(key, data), data find(key), bool hasKey(key), 


Issues:
* How to keep balances- check on every insert and remove
* Traversing the tree
