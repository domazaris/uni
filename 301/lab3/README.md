### Compilation
```
make -j2
```

### Deadlocking solution
This is a simulation that should result in deadlock. It will print the thread number along with the character 't' for thinking, or 'e' for eating.

```
./deadlock
```

### Correct solution
This solution should run indefinitely. It will display a table of each thread and its current state. This table will update rapidly.

```
./correct
```
